*Project Overview*

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of identifying pills from images. Using the publicly available all_labels.csv dataset from ePillID, the model is trained to classify pills based on their visual characteristics, aiding in quick and accurate identification.

*Motivation*

With the rise in prescription medication usage, quick and reliable pill identification can be crucial for safety, especially in healthcare environments. This tool aims to assist in identifying pills with accuracy and efficiency, potentially reducing errors and saving time.

*Features:*

	•	Comprehensive Dataset: Utilizes the all_labels.csv dataset from ePillID, covering various pills with detailed labels.
	•	Potential for Real-World Application: A tool that could be used in healthcare, pharmacies, or for individual safety purposes.

*Model Architecture:*

Our model is based on vision transformers (ViTs), which have proven effective for image classification tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use filters to detect patterns in images, transformers divide the image into patches and apply self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to learn relationships across the entire image.
