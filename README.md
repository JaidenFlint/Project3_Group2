# Pill Identifier AI Model
</h1>
</div>

*Project Overview*

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of identifying pills from images. Using the publicly available all_labels.csv dataset from ePillID, the model is trained to classify pills based on their visual characteristics, aiding in quick and accurate identification.

*Motivation*

With the rise in prescription medication usage, quick and reliable pill identification can be crucial for safety, especially in healthcare environments. This tool aims to assist in identifying pills with accuracy and efficiency, potentially reducing errors and saving time.
